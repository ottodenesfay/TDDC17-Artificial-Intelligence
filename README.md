# TDDC17-Artificial-Intelligence
This course is intended to provide the student with a broad overview of topics in the area of Artificial Intelligence. 
Due to the breadth of the area, all topics can not be covered in one introductory course. 
On the other hand, those topics that are chosen will be studied in some depth.
One of the intentions of the course is to bring some of the topics to life by showing 
how various AI technologies are used in some of the basic and applied research being pursued at the university.
